Unlike Type 1 which is a point-in-time assessment, Type 2 provides evidence that controls are not only properly designed but also operating effectively over an extended period. It''s crucial for SaaS companies and cloud service providers.', 'AICPA SOC 2 Framework', '[]'),
('CANONICAL-SOC2-TSC', 'What are the five Trust Service Criteria in SOC 2?', 'The five Trust Service Criteria are: 1) Security - protection against unauthorized access, 2) Availability - system is available for operation and use as committed, 3) Processing Integrity - system processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely and authorized, 4) Confidentiality - confidential information is protected as committed, 5) Privacy - personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed and disposed in conformity with commitments. Security is mandatory; the other four are optional based on business needs.', 'AICPA Trust Services Criteria', '[]'),
('CANONICAL-SOC2-TYPE1', 'What is SOC 2 Type 1?', 'SOC 2 Type 1 is a point-in-time audit that evaluates the design and implementation of controls at a specific date. It assesses whether controls are suitably designed to meet the Trust Service Criteria if they operate effectively. Type 1 is faster and less expensive than Type 2, but less valuable because it doesn''t test ongoing effectiveness. Organizations typically use Type 1 as a stepping stone to Type 2 or for newer companies building trust initially.', 'AICPA SOC 2 Framework', '[]'),
('CANONICAL-SOC2-TYPE2', 'What is the difference between SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2?', 'SOC 2 Type 1 is a point-in-time assessment of control design at a specific date, while Type 2 examines control effectiveness over a period (usually 6-12 months). Type 1 asks ''Are controls designed properly?'' while Type 2 asks ''Do controls work consistently over time?'' Type 2 provides much stronger assurance and is generally preferred by customers and partners. Type 2 requires more time, evidence collection, and is more expensive, but offers greater credibility.', 'AICPA SOC 2 Framework', '[]'),
('CANONICAL-SOC2-SOC1', 'What is the difference between SOC 1 and SOC 2?', 'SOC 1 focuses on controls relevant to financial reporting (used by service organizations whose services affect user entities'' financial statements).

('CANONICAL-SOC2-SOC3', 'What is SOC 3?', 'SOC 3 is a general-use report based on the same Trust Service Criteria as SOC 2, but designed for public distribution. Unlike SOC 2 (restricted distribution), SOC 3 provides only the auditor''s opinion without detailed testing procedures and results. SOC 3 is suitable for displaying on websites or marketing materials to demonstrate commitment to security. Organizations must complete SOC 2 audit to get SOC 3 report. SOC 3 offers less detail but broader distribution.', 'AICPA SOC 3 Framework', '[]'),
('CANONICAL-SOC2-SCOPE', 'How do you define SOC 2 scope?', 'SOC 2 scope definition involves: 1) Identifying systems and services to be audited, 2) Selecting applicable Trust Service Criteria (Security is mandatory, others optional), 3) Defining system boundaries and infrastructure, 4) Identifying relevant business processes, 5) Documenting third-party services, 6) Defining audit period. Scope should cover systems relevant to customer commitments. Organizations often start with narrow scope and expand in subsequent audits. Clear scope documentation is essential for auditor and customers.', 'AICPA SOC 2 Framework', '[]');
